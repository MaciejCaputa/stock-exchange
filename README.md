# Stock Exchange

## Initial Brief
```
Stock Exchange
==============

Investors buy and sell shares via a Stock Exchange. Each registered
investor can at any time announce their willingness to buy or sell a
particular quantity (say 100) of a particular share (say MSFT for
Microsoft) at a particular price (say Â£18.95), as long as they have
the required number of shares or the required amount of cash. Your
task is to implement a platform (e.g. in the form of a website), where
investors can register and log in, view their portfolio, view share
prices, and trade either manually or using an automated strategy (e.g.
"Buy 100 MSFT when MSFT drops below Â£19.00").
